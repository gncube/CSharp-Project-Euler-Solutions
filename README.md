# C# Sharp Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. I am using C# to solve the problems. I am using the .NET. I am using Visual Studio Code as my editor. I am using the [XUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) testing framework.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to get started:

```git clone
```

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) installed on your machine. You will also need to have a text editor installed. I am using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
